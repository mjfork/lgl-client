# LGL Client Implementation Summary

## Session Started: 2025-07-07 12:22:28

## Completed Work

### Planning & Analysis
- ✅ Read and analyzed LGL API specification
- ✅ Analyzed 30+ API documentation files for dependencies
- ✅ Created comprehensive dependency mapping in `dev/lgl_client/api_dependencies.md`
- ✅ Identified correct implementation order based on resource dependencies
- ✅ Resolved package structure (package-focused: `from lgl_client import new_client`)
- ✅ Finalized implementation plan with user approval

### Key Decisions Made
- **Package Structure**: Using `lgl_client/` (not `src/lgl_client/`) for production-ready imports
- **Implementation Order**: 31 resources in 5 phases based on dependency analysis
- **Testing Strategy**: Live API testing with `LGL_API_KEY` environment variable after each resource
- **Pagination**: Implement `.fetch_all()` with automatic pagination where API supports it
- **Error Handling**: Wait for user confirmation each resource works before proceeding
