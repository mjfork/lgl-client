## Standard Workflow
### 1. Start with the session setup.
If this session doesn’t already have a name, prompt for a “Session Name.” Once named, create a folder at `cc/<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS> - <Session Name>`.  Inside it, maintain three always-up-to-date files:
	•	plan.md – a working plan for the session
	•	tasks.md – a checklist of what needs to be done
	•	summary.md – a running log of changes, notes, and decisions

### 2. Think before you code.
Think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to the sesssion's tasks.md.
The plan should have a list of clear, actionable TODO items that you can check off as you complete them.

### 3. Get a second set of eyes.
Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.

### 4. Execute with simplicity.
Work through the todo list one item at a time, marking each item complete as you finish it.  Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.  After each step, write a high-level explanation of the change you made to the session's summary.md

### 5. Wrap up with a review.
Finally, add a review section to the session's summary.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
