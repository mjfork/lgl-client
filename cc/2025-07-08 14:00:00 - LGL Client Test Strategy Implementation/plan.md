# LGL Client Test Strategy Implementation Plan

## Session Name: LGL Client Test Strategy Implementation
## Date: 2025-07-08 14:00:00

## Objectives
Implement comprehensive testing strategy for the completed LGL client, focusing on the most critical areas identified for data integrity and reliability.

## Priority Areas (User-Defined)
1. **fetch_all methods** - Most likely to catch data type issues and pagination problems
2. **search/find methods** - Complex query syntax variations across different APIs

## Additional Critical Areas (Analysis-Based)
3. **Date field parsing** - Recently fixed, needs comprehensive validation
4. **Model validation** - Pydantic edge cases with optional/required fields
5. **Security features** - Input validation, credential masking, exception sanitization

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation & Critical Tests (High ROI)
- Set up pytest infrastructure with fixtures
- Mock HTTP response generators
- Core pagination tests for fetch_all methods
- Critical search method validation

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Coverage (Medium ROI)
- Model validation for all 31 resources
- Security feature verification
- Error handling edge cases
- Date parsing comprehensive tests

### Phase 3: Robustness & Performance (Lower ROI)
- Property-based testing with Hypothesis
- Load testing with large datasets
- Network failure simulation
- Memory usage validation

## Test Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/           # Mock-based, fast tests
├── integration/    # Live API tests (controlled)
├── security/       # Security feature validation
└── fixtures/       # Test data and mocks
```

## Success Criteria
- 90%+ code coverage on critical paths
- All fetch_all methods validated with edge cases
- All search syntaxes tested with real queries
- Security features verified
- Performance benchmarks established

## Risk Mitigation
Focus on highest-risk areas:
1. Pagination logic inconsistencies across 31 APIs
2. Date parsing failures in production data
3. Search query encoding with special characters
4. Memory leaks in fetch_all with large datasets
5. **Client attribute mocking inconsistencies** - 19 APIs use `self._client`, 13 use `self.client`

## Client Attribute Pattern (Critical for Test Implementation)
**APIs using `self._client`** (19 total): appeals, campaigns, categories, class_affiliation_types, client, custom_attributes, events, funds, gift_categories, gift_types, groups, invitations, keywords, mailing_templates, membership_levels, payment_types, relationship_types, team_members, types

**APIs using `self.client`** (13 total): appeal_requests, class_affiliations, constituent_relationships, constituents, email_addresses, gifts, group_memberships, memberships, notes, phone_numbers, street_addresses, volunteer_times, web_addresses
