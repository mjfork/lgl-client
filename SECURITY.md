# Security Guidelines for LGL Client

## API Key Security

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Never Commit API Keys
- **NEVER** commit `.env.local` or any file containing real API tokens
- Use `.env.example` as a template and copy to `.env.local` with real values
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to protect sensitive environment files

### API Key Best Practices
1. **Separate Environments**: Use different API keys for development, staging, and production
2. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate API keys regularly (monthly recommended)
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use API keys with minimal required permissions
4. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly review API usage logs for suspicious activity

## Debug Mode Security

### ⚠️ WARNING: Debug Mode Exposes Information
The LGL client includes a debug mode that logs request details:

```python
# Debug mode should ONLY be used in development
client = new_client(api_key, debug=True)  # ⚠️ NEVER in production
```

**Security Features:**
- API keys are automatically masked in debug output
- Sensitive fields in request bodies are sanitized
- URLs with query parameters are sanitized

**Important Notes:**
- Debug mode may still expose some sensitive information
- NEVER enable debug mode in production environments
- Be cautious when sharing debug logs

## Input Validation

### Data Sanitization
The client includes built-in protection for:
- Sensitive field detection and masking
- Exception payload sanitization
- URL parameter protection

### Recommended Practices
- Validate input data before sending to the API
- Use the client's built-in validation features
- Be cautious with user-generated content

## Exception Handling

### Secure Error Reporting
- Exception messages automatically sanitize sensitive data
- URLs in exceptions have query parameters removed
- Request payloads are sanitized before inclusion in exceptions

### Best Practices
- Don't log full exception details in production
- Use structured logging with appropriate log levels
- Monitor error patterns for security issues

## Production Deployment

### Security Checklist
- [ ] Debug mode is disabled (`debug=False`)
- [ ] API keys are stored securely (environment variables, key management service)
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] HTTPS is used for all API communications (enforced by default)
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Production environment should use secure credential storage
export LGL_API_TOKEN="your_production_token"

# Never use debug mode in production
# debug=False is the default
```

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in the LGL client:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Contact the maintainers privately
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for a fix before public disclosure

## Security Updates

- Keep the LGL client updated to the latest version
- Monitor security advisories for dependencies
- Test security updates in non-production environments first

## Data Privacy

### PII Handling
The LGL client may handle personally identifiable information (PII):
- Email addresses, phone numbers, addresses
- Financial information (donation amounts, payment details)
- Personal details (names, birth dates, relationships)

### Privacy Best Practices
- Follow your organization's data privacy policies
- Implement appropriate data retention policies
- Ensure compliance with applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Use data minimization principles

## Compliance Considerations

### Financial Data
- The LGL API handles financial information (donations, payments)
- Ensure compliance with financial regulations
- Implement appropriate audit trails

### Nonprofit Data
- Handle donor information with appropriate care
- Respect donor privacy preferences
- Implement data backup and recovery procedures
